### Assigns
#### Val
```
  private val adapter: HomeAdapter? = null
```
After the initialized It will throw an error like "Val can not be reassigned"

#### Var
```
  private var adapter: HomeAdapter? = null
```
After the initialized it will not throw me an error because var is a mutable and it can be assigned multiple times.
